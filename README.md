# SaltSensor
SaltSensor For Pi
This is an application that runs on a Raspberry Pi with a custom PCB I designed to measure salt levels in my soft-water tank. Main-1 is written in MicroPython so that it can run on my Raspberry Pi Pico.
Sonic.py is wrttien in Python so that it ran run on my Raspberry Pi Zero W.
Picodisplaysens.py is running in production with a display outside as well to keep track of the measurement as well as temperature of the Pico.
